[GAMMA-UMD](http://gamma.web.unc.edu/) has openings for summer interns.

## Introduction
Sequence Prediction is a very different task than the classical machine learning prediction task (such as predicting the weather from past years' data). Consider a narrative (movie or novel) where a very important event occurred in the beginning, but did not occur again until much later in the sequence. This is very similar to prologues in films and stories where the events in the prologue are explained much later in the narrative. The equivalent of such an event in a time-series data such as weather forecast is typically termed as an outlier and thus, ignored. Our project is on sequence prediction in terms of predicting the future trajectories (or sequences) of vehicles. 

## Project Description
<!-- In this modern *Deep Learning* age, several new approaches to trajectory prediction have emerged. However, despite the recent explosion of work in this area, surprisingly little has been done to build efficient, practical implementations of these new methods, and benchmark them against one another. -->
In this project, you will learn about deep learning and how to use deep learning tools such as PyTorch and Tensorflow for sequence prediction and apply the learned concepts to predicting vehicle trajectories. The aim of the project is to create a new trajectory prediction software. You will implement the latest methods in Python 	and benchmark them against one another using real traffic video data. 

## Prerequisites
Students need to have good programming skills in Python. Knowledge of deep learning or machine learning is NOT required, but is beneficial.

## How you might benefit from this internship
From a job perspective, machine learning and deep learning are one of the most highly valued skills in the tech industry. Practical experience in this area would set you apart from the crowd. 

From a grad school perspective, your work would be published in a good conference with you as an author. This would look good on graduate school applications. You may additionally get a letter of recommendation from the faculty member of GAMMA-UMD.

## How To Apply
Just email me with your resume and availability to work over the summer and we can set up a time to meet or Skype!
