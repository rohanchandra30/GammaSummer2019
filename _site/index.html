<h2 id="using-deep-learning-to-predict-future-trajectories-of-vehicles">Using Deep Learning To Predict Future Trajectories Of Vehicles!</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Sequence Prediction in a machine learning context is the task of teaching a machine or computer to predict the next states of the sequence given the first few instances of the sequence. This problem arises in several interesting and often important applications. A few classical applications are text-based applications (hand writing generation) and vision-based applications (image generation). Our project explores sequence prediction in the context of autonomous vehicles where we predict the future trajectories of vehicles. Here, we consider the trajectory of the vehicle as a sequence.</p>

<h3 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h3>
<!-- In this modern *Deep Learning* age, several new approaches to trajectory prediction have emerged. However, despite the recent explosion of work in this area, surprisingly little has been done to build efficient, practical implementations of these new methods, and benchmark them against one another. -->
<p>In this project, you will learn about deep learning and how to use deep learning tools such as PyTorch and Tensorflow for sequence prediction and apply the learned concepts to predicting vehicle trajectories. <strong>The aim of the project is to create a new trajectory prediction software</strong>. You will implement the latest trajectory prediction methods in Python	and benchmark them against one another using real traffic video data.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Proficiency in Python.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some experience in deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow (Even if you’ve just played around with small programs involving these tools, that’s fine.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Willingness to learn and read. In order to implement algorithms, you might need to sometimes read the original paper to see how the authors have designed the algorithm.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-you-might-benefit-from-this-internship">How you might benefit from this internship</h3>
<p>From a job perspective, implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms are one of the most highly valued skills in the tech industry. Practical experience in this area would set you apart from the crowd.</p>

<p>From a grad school perspective, your work would be published in a good conference with you as an author. This would look good on graduate school applications. You may additionally get a letter of recommendation from the faculty member of GAMMA-UMD.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-apply">How To Apply</h3>
<p>Just email me with your resume and availability to work over the summer and we can set up a time to meet or Skype!</p>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>Humans are socially-aware agents and know how to interact with others by subconsciously judging their mood, behavior and emotional state. Though made of hard nuts and bolts and lacking the five senses unlike humans, it is imperative that robots have to be made socially-aware for their co-existence with humans in day-to-day activities. Hence, one of the active research directions of Gamma-UMD is in Behavior Modeling and Affective Computing.</p>

<p>This project aims to develop AI that can predict perceived emotions of humans from various verbal and non-verbal cues. To begin with, we are interested in finding correlation between three such modalities, face, speech and gait and then come up with an informed prediction.</p>

<h3 id="project-goals-1">Project Goals</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Implement various graphical UX and data collection interfaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will also be expected to help in our data collection process, where the primary task is to annotate real world videos containing people’s face, speech, and gait with emotion labels as you perceive them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, you will be encouraged to participate in, and help the project leaders with, various research tasks such as implementation of ideas, evaluation and analysis of results, and reporting of findings. This could include literature survey of relevant papers.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Proficiency in coding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Experience in GUI designing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
