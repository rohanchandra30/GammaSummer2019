<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Sequence Prediction in a machine learning context is the task of teaching a machine or computer to predict the next states of the sequence given the first few instances of the sequence. This problem arises in several interesting and often important applications. A few classical applications are text-based applications (hand writing generation) and vision-based applications (image generation). Our project explores sequence prediction in the context of autonomous vehicles where we predict the future trajectories of vehicles. Here, we consider the trajectory of the vehicle as a sequence.</p>

<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<!-- In this modern *Deep Learning* age, several new approaches to trajectory prediction have emerged. However, despite the recent explosion of work in this area, surprisingly little has been done to build efficient, practical implementations of these new methods, and benchmark them against one another. -->
<p>In this project, you will learn about deep learning and how to use deep learning tools such as PyTorch and Tensorflow for sequence prediction and apply the learned concepts to predicting vehicle trajectories. <strong>The aim of the project is to create a new trajectory prediction software</strong>. You will implement the latest trajectory prediction methods in Python	and benchmark them against one another using real traffic video data.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Students need to have good programming skills in Python. Knowledge of deep learning or machine learning is NOT required, but is beneficial.</p>

<h2 id="how-you-might-benefit-from-this-internship">How you might benefit from this internship</h2>
<p>From a job perspective, machine learning and deep learning are one of the most highly valued skills in the tech industry. Practical experience in this area would set you apart from the crowd.</p>

<p>From a grad school perspective, your work would be published in a good conference with you as an author. This would look good on graduate school applications. You may additionally get a letter of recommendation from the faculty member of GAMMA-UMD.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How To Apply</h2>
<p>Just email me with your resume and availability to work over the summer and we can set up a time to meet or Skype!</p>
